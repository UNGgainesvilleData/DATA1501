    "# State of the Union Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "The State of the Union Address is an annual address given by the President of the United States to the Congress of the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first address was a speech given by George Washington in 1790. Some of the addresses have been given as a speech, others have been given as a letter, while some have been given as some combination of both a speech and a letter. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will consider the collection of addresses as a dataset and see if we can detect differences and similarities between the addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A text file containing 214 State of the Union addresses can be obtained from Project Gutenburg. We have downloaded this file and processed it into the file sotu.csv located in this folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how the csv file was created. The project Gutenburg file contains a lot of header and trailer information besides the original addresses, so the file needs to be processed. It was first split into 214 separate files just containing the addresses. These were then used to create bigram vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "A bigram vector of a text counts how many times each two-word sequence appears in the text. For example, the bigram vector for the text\n",

    "Our data set currently has a very large number of features or dimensions. (Think of all the possible two word combinations) To be able to view the data set we need to somehow reduce the number of dimensions while still retaining most of the variation in the data. One popular technique is to conduct Princple Component Analysis or PCA for short. PCA detemines the directions in which a sample varies the most. It is by far the most popular way for dimensional reduction. In general there will still be many components after conducting PCA. The csv file just contains the first two components. Think of this as reducing our data set to just a two-dimensional data set where the two dimensions are the directions that the data varies the most.\n",
